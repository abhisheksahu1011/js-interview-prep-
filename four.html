        What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
        =>The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

        Let's see this behavior with an example,
        
        function somemethod() {
          console.log(counter1); // undefined
          console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
          var counter1 = 1;
          let counter2 = 2;
        }
        






        What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax
        =>The for-in loop is a special type of a loop that iterates over the properties of an object, or the elements of an array. for - in loop : returns you the indexes of the arrayThe generic syntax of the for-in loop is:

        for(variable in object) {
            // Code to be executed
        }
        

        



        Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript
        =>
        Global scope:A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.
        var a=3;
        
        function greet()
        {
        
        console.log(a);
        
        }
        greet()
        
        Local scope:A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a function.
        var a=4;
        function add()
        {
        var  q=4;
        console.log(a+b);
        
        
        }
        greet()
        
         console.log(a+q);error
        q will be not accesible as it was defined inside the function
        
        Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var do not have block scope.
        Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.
        {
          let abcd = 45;
        }
         console.log(abcd);reference error as it was defined inside the block
        
        
        scope chain:JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables.
        
        var x=24;
        function OuterFunction()
        {
        var s=224;
        
        var innerfunction=function innerfunction()
        {
        
        console.log(s);
        
        }
        var innerfunction2=function innerfunction2()
        {
        
        
        console.log(x);
        
        }
        innerfunction();
        innerfunction2();
        
        
        }
        OuterFunction();

        










        What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
        =>In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as:

        var testVar; alert(testVar); //shows undefined
        
         alert(typeof testVar); //shows undefined
        
        null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:
        
        var testVar = null; alert(testVar); //shows null
         alert(typeof testVar); //shows object

         

        what is Symbol?
        =>symbol is used to give an unique value which is immutable(which cannt be changed )

        const val1=Symbol("hello")
        const val2=Symbol("hellow")
        console.log(val1===val2)
        though the values and data type are same we will get an output of false because foe each and every symbol unique value is genereated
        
        because everytime its creating unique symbol


        Write code to explain map and filter in arrays
            =>Map is used to retur a new Array
            map is used to iterrate through each and every element in an array
        
            var numbers= [1,2,3,4,5];
            var newNum  = numbers.map(n => n + 0.5);
            newNum; // 
        
        
            Filter:Which is used to filter the items in an array
        
                  var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
                  var greaterThan2 = numbers.filter(n => n > 2);
                  greaterThan2; // [3,4,5]  

















        Explain passed by value and passed by reference
            =>pass by value means that we pass the actual value of the variable into the function.
            pass by reference means that instead of passing the value of the variable,we pass the address of variable(location) to the function.
            
                var a=2;
                var b=a;
                console.log(a);//2
                console.log(b);//2
                a=4;
                console.log(a);//4
                console.log(b);//2




        Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code
            =>self invoking functions are kind of an anonymous function which gets invoked automatically after its declaration.we dont have to manually invoke it.

            (function(){
                let x="hello there!";
                console.log(x);
            })();
