    What are promises and why do we need them?
    =>A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
    A Promise is in one of these states:
    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
    Benefits of Promises
    1. Improves Code Readability
     2. Better handling of asynchronous operations
     3. Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic




     What is the purpose of async/await keywords?
     An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.



     What is hoisting?
     Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,
                    console.log(message); //output : undefined 
                    var message = 'The variable Has been hoisted';
                    var message;
                    console.log(message);//output :The variable Has been hoisted;

    
                    

    What is the DOM?
    
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.   
    
    
    Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
    Undefined:
     undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined to any variable that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined. 
     
     null It is one of JavaScript’s primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.null is an empty or non-existent value and null must be assigned. We use null when we want to explicitly declare that a variable is empty.


    not defined : A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let, or const.

















    
    How many operators do we have in JS ?
    We have 6 types of operators in JS they are
     1. Arithmetic Operators
     2. Comparison Operators
     3. Logical Operators 
     4. Assignment Operators
     5. Conditional Operators
     6. Ternary Operator









    
What are pure functions?
Pure Function is a function that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.

function calculateGST( productPrice ){
     return productPrice * 0.05; 
    }







    What is callback hell
    Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. 
    The callback hell looks like below,
            async1(function(){
                async2(function(){ 
                    async3(function(){
                        async4(function(){ 
                            .... 
                        });
                    });
                }); 
            });







 What is promise chaining
 The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,
        new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
        }).






 What are arrow functions?

 Arrow Functions — also called “fat arrow” functions, are relatively a new way of writing concise functions in JavaScript. They have been introduced by the ECMAScript 6 specifications and since then become the most popular ES6 feature.
  Arrow functions allow us to use the fat arrow => operator to quickly define JavaScript functions, with or without parameters.
   We are able to omit the curly braces and the function and return keywords.
   

   for example:
   let x = (x, y) => x * y;






   Give an example of async/await
   
   
   async function f() {

    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
    });
  
    let result = await promise;
  
    alert(result); // "done!"
  }
  
  f();
