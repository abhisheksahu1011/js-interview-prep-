           Que1 ) Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
           => 1.Both are comparision aperators.
            2.The difference between both operators is "==" is use to comapre the value it not compare datatypes.
            3."===" operator is use to compare both value and datatypes.    
            for exmaple:
            var x= "1";
            var y= [1];

            console.log(x==y); =>It will return true it will check only value.
            console.log(x===y); =>It will return tFalse it will check both value and datatype.

            What is the spread operator?
            => The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of  objects. Using this operator we can enhances its readability of code. 
            
            Spread Operaator is use to join all arrays by using "...""  It allow to copy all arraay and create new array with complete  data of all arrays.

            the syntax of spread operator is ("...")
            for exmaple;
                     const num1=[1,2,3,4]
                      const num2=[5,6,7,8]
                      const combnum = [...num1,...num2]
                      console.log( combnum)
                       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

            What are the differences between var, let and const?
            => var is a Global or Functional Scoped.it can be reassigned or redeclared and it can be modified later.
            =>let is a Block Scoped.it cannot be reassigned or redeclare. let can be modified later.
            =>const is a Block Scoped.it cannot be reassigned or redeclare.const cannot be modified later.

            What is execution context
            => A special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.

            During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
                There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
                ●	Global Execution Context (GEC)
                ●	Function Execution Context (FEC)

        What is meant by first class functions.
        A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

            1.Example 

            const first = function() {
            console.log("return");
            }
            first(); 
            // return
